# 52. Virtual Filesystem

> Status: Implemented through Stage 3; single VFS JavaScript module system and canvas mirrors planned

I wanted the ability to persist, browse and resolve files in a virtual file system.

## Goals

- I want to be able to have a virtual filesystem with directories and files
- I want to be able to resolve the content of folders anG files from many providers
  - example: some files might be resolved from a static url, while other files and folders may need to be loaded from user's filesystem
- I want to be able to visually browse that filesystem
  - e.g. with "Command Palette > Toggle Sidebar"
  - should show up in a collapsible sidebar on the left side
  - See files and directories in a tree structure
  - Be able to view files. See images and hear audio files.
  - Create and delete files and directories
  - Set a "provider" on where to load a specific file or directory
    - e.g. you might load video.mp4 from a URL, but you might load super-secret.jpeg from your own local filesystem
- The UI should be able to show "unmapped files"
- API-wise, it should be easy to write your own provider.
  - Ideally we have a class for providers e.g. `LocalFilesystemProvider`, `UrlProvider`

## Providers

- Local Filesystem: use the `Filesystem` browser API to map the virtual filesystem file and folder to the user's local folder
  - default when the file dragged into the canvas or obj
- URL: load that file content from a given URL
  - creating an object with a default url e.g. `img <url>` should use the URL provider automatically
  - using a message to set the url should use the URL provider automatically
- (Future) cloud providers: dragging a file into Patchies can upload it to a default cloud provider automatically e.g. S3, Minio

## Example

```txt
/user
  /images
    /poom.jpg  -- {provider: 'url', url: 'https://poom.dev/cool'}
  /secrets     -- {provider: 'local'}
```

## Design Ideas

- Each object must only store the virtual filesystem path, it must not store the file object.
- Create a singleton class `VirtualFilesystem` for accessing the virtual filesystem.
- Patchies vfs has two prefixes:
  - `user://` is for user uploaded files. example: `user://images/poom.jpg`
  - `obj://` is for files associated with obj, using `/<object-id>` as prefixes.
    - example: `obj://chuck~-24` contains filesystem for a ChucK object
    - example: `obj://elem~-36` contains filesystem for an Elementary Audio object
    - example: `obj://csound~-42` contains filesystem for a Csound object
    - only some node will have a virtual node filesystem, such as `chuck~` and `elem~` and `csound~`
  - the prefixes helps us to check if it is a virtual filesystem path, or an already resolved path.
- Saved patches store a `files` mapping for persistent namespaces such as `user://`. The `obj://` tree is runtime-only and is rebuilt from the objects in the patch; serializing it would create a second source of truth.

```ts
{
    "nodes": [],
    "edges": [],
    "files": {
        "user": {
            "images": {
                "poom.mp4": {
                    provider: "url",
                    url: "https://"
                },
                "foobar.mp4": {
                    provider: "local",
                },
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Integration Paths

- persist uploaded media in media source objects
  - images (`img`)
  - video (`video`)
  - sound (`soundfile~`)
  - converted recorded samples in `sampler~`

- Deeper integration will be in [53. Virtual Filesystem Object Integrations](./53-virtual-filesystem-object-integrations.md)

---

## Implementation Plan (Phase 1: `img` node only)

### Scope

Focus on the `img` node as the first integration point. This validates the VFS architecture before expanding to `video`, `soundfile~`, and other nodes.

### File Structure

```text
src/lib/vfs/
├── VirtualFilesystem.ts        # Singleton, main API
├── types.ts                    # VFSEntry, VFSProvider, VFSTree types
├── path-utils.ts               # Path parsing, collision handling
├── persistence.ts              # IndexedDB for FileSystemHandles
└── providers/
    ├── UrlProvider.ts          # Resolve from URL
    └── LocalFilesystemProvider.ts  # File System Access API
```

### Core Types

```ts
// types.ts
export type VFSProviderType = "url" | "local";

export interface VFSEntry {
  provider: VFSProviderType;
  url?: string; // for 'url' provider
  filename: string; // original filename for display
  mimeType?: string; // e.g., 'image/png'
}

export interface VFSProvider {
  type: VFSProviderType;
  resolve(entry: VFSEntry): Promise<File | Blob>;
  canPersist(): boolean;
}

// Tree structure for serialization (matches patch format)
export interface VFSTree {
  user?: Record<string, VFSEntry | VFSTree>;
}
```

### VirtualFilesystem Singleton API

```ts
class VirtualFilesystem {
  static getInstance(): VirtualFilesystem;

  // Registration
  registerFile(path: string, entry: VFSEntry): void;
  registerUrl(url: string): Promise<string>; // returns generated path

  // Resolution
  resolve(path: string): Promise<File | Blob>;
  getEntry(path: string): VFSEntry | undefined;

  // Path utilities
  isVFSPath(path: string): boolean; // checks for user:// or obj:// prefix

  // Listing
  list(prefix?: string): string[]; // list all paths under prefix

  // Persistence
  serialize(): VFSTree; // for patch save
  hydrate(tree: VFSTree): Promise<void>; // for patch load

  // Permission management (for local files after reload)
  getPendingPermissions(): string[]; // paths needing user permission
  requestPermission(path: string): Promise<boolean>;
  requestAllPermissions(): Promise<Map<string, boolean>>;

  // Cleanup
  remove(path: string): void;
  clear(): void;
}
```

### IndexedDB Schema (for FileSystemHandle persistence)

```ts
// persistence.ts
// DB: 'patchies-vfs'
// Store: 'handles'
// Key: VFS path (e.g., 'user://images/photo.jpg')
// Value: FileSystemFileHandle

async function storeHandle(
  path: string,
  handle: FileSystemFileHandle,
): Promise<void>;
async function getHandle(
  path: string,
): Promise<FileSystemFileHandle | undefined>;
async function removeHandle(path: string): Promise<void>;
async function getAllHandles(): Promise<Map<string, FileSystemFileHandle>>;
async function clearHandles(): Promise<void>;
```

### Path Generation (collision handling)

```ts
// path-utils.ts
function generateUserPath(
  filename: string,
  existingPaths: Set<string>,
): string {
  // Input: 'photo.jpg'
  // Output: 'user://images/photo.jpg' or 'user://images/photo-1.jpg' if collision

  const ext = getExtension(filename); // '.jpg'
  const base = getBasename(filename); // 'photo'
  const category = getCategoryFromMime(); // 'images' | 'videos' | 'audio' | 'files'

  let path = `user://${category}/${filename}`;
  let counter = 1;
  while (existingPaths.has(path)) {
    path = `user://${category}/${base}-${counter}${ext}`;
    counter++;
  }
  return path;
}
```

### ImageNode Changes

```svelte
<!-- Before -->
data: {
  fileName?: string;
  file?: File;        // ephemeral, lost on reload
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
}

<!-- After -->
data: {
  vfsPath?: string;   // e.g., 'user://images/photo.jpg'
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
}
```

**Load flow:**

1. `onMount` → check `node.data.vfsPath`
2. If exists → `vfs.resolve(vfsPath)` → load into GLSystem
3. If resolution fails (permission needed) → show placeholder with "grant permission" button

**Drop/select flow:**

1. User drops file → `vfs.storeFile(file)` → returns path
2. Store path in `node.data.vfsPath`
3. Load image into GLSystem

**URL message flow:**

1. Receive URL message → `vfs.registerUrl(url)` → returns path
2. Store path in `node.data.vfsPath`
3. Load image into GLSystem

### Save/Load Integration

**PatchSaveFormat update:**

```ts
export type PatchSaveFormat = {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  timestamp: number;
  nodes: Node[];
  edges: Edge[];
  files?: VFSTree; // NEW
};
```

**Serialize:**

```ts
function serializePatch(): PatchSaveFormat {
  const vfs = VirtualFilesystem.getInstance();
  return {
    // ...existing fields
    files: vfs.serialize(),
  };
}
```

**Restore:**

```ts
async function restorePatchFromSave(patch: PatchSaveFormat) {
  const vfs = VirtualFilesystem.getInstance();
  vfs.clear();

  if (patch.files) {
    await vfs.hydrate(patch.files);
  }

  // Check for pending permissions
  const pending = vfs.getPendingPermissions();
  if (pending.length > 0) {
    // Show permission prompt UI
    showPermissionPrompt(pending);
  }

  // ...rest of restore logic
}
```

### Permission Prompt UI

When loading a patch with local files, show a modal/toast:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Some files need permission to access   │
│                                         │
│  📁 photo.jpg                           │
│  📁 background.png                      │
│                                         │
│  [Grant All Permissions]  [Skip]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Alternatively, in a future file browser sidebar, highlight files needing permission with a 🔒 icon.

### Migration

```ts
// migrations/002-add-files-field.ts
export const migration002: Migration = {
  version: 2,
  name: "add-files-field",
  migrate(patch: RawPatchData): RawPatchData {
    return {
      ...patch,
      files: patch.files ?? { user: {} },
    };
  },
};
```

### Implementation Order

1. **Core infrastructure** — types, path-utils, VirtualFilesystem class (in-memory only)
2. **Providers** — UrlProvider, LocalFilesystemProvider
3. **IndexedDB persistence** — store/retrieve FileSystemHandles
4. **ImageNode integration** — update to use VFS paths
5. **Save/load integration** — serialize/hydrate VFS tree
6. **Permission UI** — prompt for local file permissions on load
7. **Migration** — add migration 002

### Testing Checklist

- [x] Drop image file → stored in VFS → displays correctly
- [x] Send URL message → stored in VFS → displays correctly
- [x] Save patch → VFS tree included in JSON
- [x] Load patch with URL files → resolves automatically
- [x] Load patch with local files → prompts for permission → resolves after grant
- [x] Collision handling → `photo.jpg`, `photo-1.jpg`, `photo-2.jpg`
- [x] Delete node → VFS entry remains (intentional, for undo support)
- [x] Clear patch → VFS cleared

## User-Code API

JavaScript-capable objects expose a single asynchronous `vfs` helper. It replaces the former `getVfsUrl` global.

```javascript
await vfs.get("./data.json").json(); // read and parse file contents
await vfs.get("./notes.txt").text(); // read file contents as text
await vfs.getUrl("./foo.png"); // resolves user://foo.png to an object URL
await vfs.getUrl("user://foo.png"); // explicit VFS path
await vfs.list("."); // direct entries of user:// as { path, name, kind }
await vfs.search("foo", "./assets"); // recursively search entries under user://assets
```

`vfs.get(path)` returns a lazy reader with `json()`, `text()`, `blob()`, and `arrayBuffer()` methods. Each method resolves and fetches the file, then returns the requested representation. Relative paths default to `user://`; absolute external URLs passed to `get` or `getUrl` remain external. `list` is non-recursive and returns entries with full VFS paths, names, and file or directory kinds. `search` is case-insensitive, recursive, and returns matching entries in the same shape. Both methods traverse linked local folders after permission has been granted.

## Patch-Local Text Files and Editing

Patchies needs an explicit ownership boundary between files embedded in a patch and files resolved from outside it. Provider metadata alone is not enough: a `user://` entry may refer to a filesystem handle, URL, or browser-local IndexedDB fallback, while small source files should travel with the saved patch.

### Namespaces and Ownership

The VFS has three namespaces:

| Namespace  | Ownership                               | Persistence                                     | Editing in the Files panel            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `patch://` | Embedded in the current patch           | Serialized under `files.patch`                  | Supported text files are editable     |
| `user://`  | External or browser-local user resource | Handle, URL, or patch-scoped IndexedDB fallback | Read-only in the first editor release |
| `obj://`   | Object-owned resource                   | Runtime-only; rebuilt from object state         | Edit existing object code only            |

An embedded entry uses the `embedded` provider and stores UTF-8 text directly:

```ts
interface EmbeddedVFSEntry extends VFSEntry {
  provider: "embedded";
  content: string;
}
```

`embedded` entries are valid only under `patch://`, and every entry under `patch://` must be embedded. Patch JSON stores the namespace alongside the existing trees:

```ts
interface VFSTree {
  patch?: Record<string, VFSTreeNode>;
  user?: Record<string, VFSTreeNode>;
}
```

`obj://` is deliberately excluded from `VFSTree`. Object-owned entries are a virtual runtime view of each object's own state. Serialization and hydration ignore that namespace so patch files never contain a competing copy.

The serialized text is a normal JSON string, not base64. Limits use UTF-8 byte length:

- 256 KiB maximum per embedded file
- 1 MiB maximum total embedded content per patch
- UTF-8 text only

The editable formats under `patch://` are:

- JavaScript: `.js`, `.mjs`
- GLSL: `.gl`, `.glsl`, `.frag`, `.vert`, `.glslf`, `.glslv`

Only `.js` and `.glsl` are inferred when an import omits its extension. Other supported extensions must be explicit.

### Files Panel

The Files tree shows namespace roots in this order:

1. Patch (always visible)
2. User (always visible)
3. Objects (always visible)

Each root label has a tooltip on hover and keyboard focus:

- **Patch:** Files saved inside this patch. They're included when you save or share it.
- **User:** Files from your device or the web. The patch saves links, not the files themselves.
- **Objects:** Code from the objects in this patch. Edits here also update the object.

The drop target declares ownership:

- Drop into Patch: copy allowed text into `patch://` and serialize it with the patch.
- Drop into User: retain the linked-file behavior under `user://`.
- Drop User to Patch: copy and embed; retain the linked original.
- Patch to User is not an internal move. Use **Save to Disk…** to export a copy without changing ownership.

Patch folder drops are atomic. Patchies embeds the complete folder only when every file is allowed and the result fits within the patch budget. Otherwise it embeds nothing and reports the offending files. Name collisions show Replace, Keep Both, and Cancel; replacement is undoable, and Keep Both uses numbered suffixes.

New File is available in Patch and its folders. It creates empty content, requires an explicit supported extension, rejects case-sensitive duplicate paths, and opens the new file in the editor. An empty GLSL file shows a non-persisted example function placeholder so users know the file can contain reusable GLSL functions.

### Editor Behavior (Patch Files)

These draft and save rules apply to `patch://`. Objects files use the live editing
behavior described under **Live object code namespace** below.

Double-clicking an editable Patch file, or choosing **Edit** from its context menu, transforms the Files panel into a CodeMirror editor. Search results provide the same actions. On mobile, Edit appears in the selection toolbar. A single click continues to select a row.

The editor header contains:

- Back
- the path relative to the `patch://` root, without the namespace prefix
- a dirty indicator
- an icon-only Save button with a shortcut tooltip
- Rename, Copy Path, Save to Disk, and Delete in an overflow menu

CodeMirror keeps a local draft. Save is explicit; unsaved drafts do not change consumers. The Save button, `Cmd/Ctrl+S`, `Shift+Enter`, and Vim `:w` run the same Save action. Inline value-widget changes also save immediately so shader consumers refresh while the value is adjusted.

Back, opening another file, loading another patch, rename while dirty, and every action that hides or leaves the Files sidebar use one Save / Discard / Cancel guard. This includes the sidebar keyboard shortcut, command palette, tab and context-menu actions, close control, and bottom toolbar. Browser reload and window close use the standard unsaved-changes warning.

Invalid JavaScript or GLSL remains saveable because include files may not compile independently and users may save work in progress. Save validates only path, UTF-8 encoding, and size. Consumers retain their last working output when the saved source fails.

CodeMirror undo and redo apply to the draft. Each successful Save is one global history operation. Create, delete, rename, replacement, and User-to-Patch copy also participate in global undo. Restoring clean open content updates the editor without remounting it; a dirty editor shows a conflict guard. Undoing creation of the open file returns to the tree, while undoing a rename updates the open path.

### File Modification Contract

Saving or restoring embedded content emits a path-specific modification with a monotonic content revision. File size alone is not a valid revision because same-length edits must invalidate consumers.

The modification contract:

- synchronizes saved JavaScript modules to every JSRunner environment;
- reruns direct and transitive JavaScript dependents;
- clears affected GLSL VFS caches;
- recompiles direct and transitive shader consumers;
- preserves the previous working output on failure and reports the new error.

Hydration registers all `patch://` files before node runtimes start. A manually edited patch that exceeds the embedded budget still loads its graph for recovery, but Patchies refuses to open or execute offending files and offers their paths and sizes so users can delete or export them.

### Compatibility

Existing `user://` entries are not converted to `patch://`. A patch migration adds an empty `files.patch` tree when missing.

IndexedDB remains a fallback for browsers without filesystem handles and a persistence store for handles, but new keys are scoped by patch ID plus VFS path. When a scoped record is missing, Patchies may read a matching legacy path-only record once and copy it to the scoped key. It does not delete the legacy record because another old patch may still reference it.

The existing user-code VFS API keeps its current defaults: `vfs.getUrl("./foo")`, `vfs.list(".")`, and similar relative paths resolve under `user://`. The `patch://` shorthand applies only to JavaScript imports and GLSL includes.

### Internal Architecture

`VirtualFilesystem` is the stable public facade. Its implementation composes internal modules so provider, persistence, history, browsing, and Patch-file rules do not accumulate in the facade:

- `VfsEntryIndex` owns the in-memory entry map and all path-tree calculations, including rename and deletion plans.
- `VfsDirectoryReader` owns directory listing, pagination, recursive search, and traversal of linked local folders.
- `VfsTreeCodec` converts between the flat entry index and the serialized patch tree without accessing providers or UI state.
- `VfsPermissionTracker` owns paths that need file or directory permission and scans hydrated entries against the local provider.
- `PatchFileOperations` owns the complete `patch://` lifecycle. It delegates atomic import staging to `PatchImportPlanner` and applies the same embedded-content policy to create, write, read, export, import, and recovery hydration.
- `VfsMutationCoordinator` records complete VFS state transitions as one global history operation and serializes asynchronous provider effects from undo and redo.

The Files panel continues to own user interaction such as asking whether to Replace, Keep Both, or Cancel. Browser `DataTransfer` traversal stays in a separate adapter. These modules report plans and outcomes; they do not depend on Svelte UI state.

## Initial Delivery Plan

The initial feature shipped in exactly three pull requests. Each pull request is a complete release point with its own user outcome and focused verification. Tests stay in the same commit as the behavior they verify; do not create preparatory commits containing only types or unused helpers.

### Stage 1: Portable Patch Files

Users can store small files inside a patch, save and share them, and manage them from the Files tree. Patch files are not editable in this stage.

Scope:

- add the `patch://` namespace and `embedded` provider;
- serialize and hydrate contents under `files.patch`;
- migrate older patches with an empty Patch namespace;
- enforce UTF-8, per-file, and per-patch size limits;
- show Patch, User, and Objects roots in the Files tree;
- make OS drops namespace-sensitive;
- support User-to-Patch copy, Save to Disk, collision handling, and atomic folder imports;
- make VFS create, write, replace, rename, delete, and copy operations globally undoable;
- scope new IndexedDB keys by patch ID and VFS path, with non-destructive legacy fallback.

Verification:

1. Embedded contents survive serialize and hydrate round trips.
2. Older patches load with an empty Patch namespace without converting `user://` entries.
3. Invalid provider and namespace combinations and size violations are rejected.
4. Two patches using the same `user://` path do not share browser-local bytes or handles.
5. Files-tree tests cover namespace order, each drop target, rejected and atomic drops, collisions, export, and history.
6. Undo and redo restore VFS state and content revisions for every mutation.

Release criterion: Patch files are portable and manageable through the Files tree without requiring the editor or a runtime import consumer.

### Stage 2: Patch GLSL Editing and Imports

Status: Implemented.

Users can create, edit, and import GLSL utilities from `patch://`. JavaScript Patch files remain visible and portable but read-only until Stage 3.

Scope:

- transform the Files panel into a CodeMirror editor for supported GLSL files;
- support New File for GLSL files in Patch folders;
- implement drafts, dirty state, equivalent button / shortcut / Vim `:w` saves, and the shared navigation guard;
- provide the same GLSL assistance as the `glsl` object;
- save inline value-widget edits and refresh shader consumers immediately;
- add Edit actions to normal rows, search results, and the mobile toolbar;
- resolve relative, explicit Patch, and explicit User GLSL includes;
- infer only the `.glsl` extension;
- invalidate affected caches and direct and transitive shader consumers after saved revisions;
- report missing includes in the consumer's virtual console and highlight the originating `#include` line;
- retain the last working visual output when saved source fails.

Verification:

1. Session and integration tests cover draft isolation, Save-triggered invalidation, and global history while the editor is open. Manual UI verification covers the row, search, and mobile entry points; the Save button, `Cmd/Ctrl+S`, `Shift+Enter`, and Vim `:w`; and Save / Discard / Cancel navigation because the repository does not have a rendered component-test harness for the Files panel.
2. Resolver tests cover relative, explicit, inferred-extension, circular, and namespace-escape cases.
3. Saved changes refresh direct and transitive consumers exactly once.
4. Unsaved drafts do not invalidate consumers.
5. Invalid saved source reports an error and preserves the previous visual output.
6. Worker and system tests verify that a missing VFS include reaches the consumer's virtual console with the originating `#include` line diagnostic. Manually verify the rendered CodeMirror line highlight.
7. Unit tests cover inline value-widget rerun policy. Manually verify that a widget edit saves the Patch file and refreshes its shader consumers.

Release criterion: GLSL Patch-file authoring works end to end without depending on JavaScript module support.

### Stage 3: Patch JavaScript Editing and Modules

Status: Implemented.

Users can edit Patch JavaScript modules and import them in every JSRunner-backed environment.

Scope:

- enable `.js` and `.mjs` in the Patch editor with module-specific CodeMirror behavior;
- centralize JS module resolution for Rollup, dependency readiness, workers, and dependent lookup;
- preserve the then-existing canvas-library precedence and add Patch-root fallback;
- support standard relative and explicit VFS imports;
- report structured missing-import errors promptly;
- hydrate and register Patch modules before runtime execution;
- synchronize modules to main-thread, dedicated-worker, and render-worker JSRunner environments;
- generalize dependency tracking from source node IDs to canonical module sources;
- rerun direct and transitive importers after Save and global undo;
- retain last-working runtime or visual output on failure where the owning runtime supports it.

Verification:

1. Resolver tests cover the then-existing canvas libraries, Patch-root fallback, relative, explicit Patch, explicit User, npm, and URL precedence.
2. The same Patch module imports successfully in every JSRunner environment.
3. Hydration completes before importer execution.
4. Missing imports fail promptly with structured diagnostics rather than a dependency timeout or empty program.
5. Alias, relative, explicit, and transitive dependencies rerun in dependency order exactly once.
6. Existing canvas-library, npm, URL, and `user://` behavior remains compatible at the Stage 3 release point.

Release criterion: JavaScript Patch modules work end to end with automatic synchronization and dependent reruns.

### Follow-up: Single VFS JavaScript Module System

Status: Planned.

Patch JavaScript files become the only importable user modules. Inline `js` objects remain executable scripts, while an optional canvas object can mirror a Patch file for editing. Spec 121 owns the complete resolution, editing, file/mirror lifecycle, rename-rewrite, diagnostic, and undo contracts.

Scope:

- remove the canvas-library parser, registry, node-data mode, precedence, and source directive without migration or compatibility behavior;
- resolve non-relative user module specifiers directly from canonical paths under `patch://`, including nested paths and `.js` inference;
- keep NPM, URL, relative, and explicit VFS resolution unambiguous;
- create one editor-only canvas mirror when a Patch `.js` or `.mjs` file is dragged onto the canvas;
- share one draft, dirty state, conflict guard, CodeMirror history, and committed revision between Files and a canvas mirror;
- use Save or Run to commit through the existing Patch-file mutation contract and rerun direct and transitive dependents;
- rewrite supported JavaScript module specifiers during atomic file and folder renames;
- keep the canonical file when its mirror is deleted, and remove affected mirrors when files are deleted;
- reject invalid paths, collisions, and incomplete rename staging without partial writes.

Verification:

1. Root and nested Patch shorthand resolve to canonical VFS modules without source declarations.
2. File drops create at most one editor-only canvas mirror per Patch file.
3. Canvas and Files share one guarded draft and commit through the same module revision.
4. Save and Run synchronize and rerun direct and transitive consumers exactly once.
5. Rename rewrites supported imports atomically, and deletion follows the asymmetric file/mirror lifecycle with exact undo and redo.
6. The removed canvas-library mechanism has no remaining runtime or UI behavior.
7. Invalid paths, collisions, and failed rename staging preserve all prior persisted state.

Release criterion: Patch VFS files are the only user-module source, and optional canvas mirrors edit them without adding runtime identity or duplicate ownership.

## Live object code namespace

`obj://` exposes an always-visible **Objects** root. Existing code-bearing objects
appear as `<node-id>/<filename>`, including `glsl-4/shader.glsl` and `js-6/code.js`.
A transport-independent representation maps object type, data field, filename,
language, and source text. Remote sync can consume this representation without
Svelte, XYFlow, or VFS storage dependencies.

Object files are derived from current graph data, never serialized into the VFS
tree. Listing, reading, search, and Files editing use this live projection.
Typing updates the original data field immediately, with normal node undo history
committed at editing boundaries. Graph edits, undo, replacement, and deletion
refresh the projection. Objects without source code expose no files.

Only existing source contents can be edited. Creating, uploading, replacing,
renaming, moving, or deleting entries under `obj://` is rejected by the VFS and
unavailable in desktop/mobile file controls. Object creation is out of scope.

### Object editor synchronization and execution

Existing object source is authoritative when it changes externally: an open or
reopened Objects editor immediately refreshes from that source. Patch-file drafts
retain their conflict protection.
CodeMirror applies external values without emitting a user-edit callback.

Shift+Enter commits the current editing gesture and invokes the object's registered
Run handler after the editor state settles. It also reruns unchanged source.
Cmd/Ctrl+S only commits the editing gesture; source changes have already propagated.
Hosts without a mounted editor use the existing executeCode trigger.

### Bidirectional live object editing

Typing in an Objects file immediately updates its object data, just like typing
in the main object editor. Objects files have no isolated unsaved draft. Save,
Run, blur, and navigation commit a single undo step for the editing gesture;
Run alone requests execution. Undo and redo use node history and update both
editors. Patch files retain their explicit save/discard drafts.

Objects file editors retain the source object's editor type. Inline value widgets
use the main editor's rerun policy and throttle, including automatic Hydra reruns
while adjusting values.

Object-file projection updates metadata only for changed sources. Unchanged
sources are not re-encoded or rebuilt on each keystroke.

current main ChucK editor; it does not yet use a dedicated ChucK grammar.
