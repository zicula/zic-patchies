# 95. Chat Canvas Actions

> **Status: IMPLEMENTED** ✓

## Overview

Extend ChatView with the ability to perform canvas mutations (create, edit, replace, decompose, etc.) via tool calls, while sharing all resolver logic with `AiObjectPrompt`. The floating `AiObjectPrompt` dialog is unchanged — it remains the fast "quick edit" path. ChatView becomes the conversational path to the same underlying operations.

---

## Mental Model

|                | AiObjectPrompt           | ChatView                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| UX pattern     | Quick command palette    | Conversational assistant               |
| Apply behavior | Auto-apply (optimistic)  | Explicit confirm via ActionCard        |
| Context        | Explicitly selected node | Node context at time of tool call      |
| Output         | Directly mutates canvas  | Prose + optional ActionCards in thread |

---

## Architecture

```
ChatView                      AiObjectPrompt
chat/resolver.ts              ai-prompt-controller.svelte.ts
      ↓                              ↓
      └───────────────┬──────────────┘
                      ↓
              src/lib/ai/modes/
         resolvers + descriptors (spec 94)
                      ↓
              Canvas callbacks
```

No resolver duplication. The mode system from spec 94 (`AiModeDescriptor`, `AiModeResult`, resolver files) is the shared foundation. ChatView consumes it via tool definitions; AiObjectPrompt consumes it via `AiPromptController`.

---

## Chat Tool Definitions

The chat system prompt is extended with tool definitions auto-derived from the mode descriptor registry. Each mode that makes sense in a conversational context gets a tool:

```typescript
// src/lib/ai/chat/canvas-tools.ts

export function buildCanvasToolDefinitions(
  descriptors: AiModeDescriptor[],
): ToolDefinition[] {
  return descriptors
    .filter((d) => d.availableInChat) // opt-in per descriptor
    .map((d) => ({
      name: d.id, // e.g. "edit", "create", "replace"
      description: d.chatToolDescription,
      inputSchema: d.chatToolSchema, // JSON Schema for the tool input
    }))
}
```

### Tool inputs (examples)

| Tool        | Input                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `single`    | `{ prompt: string }`                                    |
| `multi`     | `{ prompt: string }`                                    |
| `edit`      | `{ nodeId: string, prompt: string }`                    |
| `replace`   | `{ nodeId: string, prompt: string }`                    |
| `fix-error` | `{ nodeId: string, errors: string[], prompt?: string }` |
| `decompose` | `{ nodeId: string, prompt: string }`                    |

## ActionCard Component

When the chat AI returns a tool call, an `ActionCard.svelte` is rendered inline in the message thread.

```
Claude: I'll update the oscillator frequency for you.
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ✏️  Edit: osc-1                                      │
│                                                     │
│  frequency: 200 → 440                               │
│  detune: 0 (unchanged)                              │
│                                                     │
│  [Apply]                              [Dismiss]     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

States:

- **Pending**: Apply / Dismiss buttons shown. The resolver has already run and produced an `AiModeResult` — no extra latency on confirm.
- **Applied**: Green check, "Applied" label, no buttons. Thread remains readable.
- **Dismissed**: Dimmed, "Dismissed" label.
- **Loading**: Spinner while resolver runs (before ActionCard is shown).

ActionCard uses the mode descriptor's `color` and `icon` for visual styling — same as AiObjectPrompt.

---

## Execution Flow

```
1. User sends message in ChatView
2. chat/resolver.ts streams response
3a. Text chunk → append to assistant bubble (existing behavior)
3b. Tool call → run the mode resolver immediately
     - Shows "running tool..." indicator in stream
     - Resolver produces AiModeResult
4. AiModeResult → render ActionCard in thread (pending state)
5. User clicks Apply
     → call canvas callback (onInsertObject / onEditObject / etc.)
     → ActionCard transitions to applied state
     → chat continues (AI can see the tool result and respond)
6. User clicks Dismiss
     → ActionCard dims
     → chat continues (AI sees the tool was dismissed)
```

Resolvers run eagerly when the tool call arrives — not on confirm. This means there's no extra latency when the user hits Apply. The `AiModeResult` is cached on the ActionCard until applied or dismissed.

---

## Context Passing

The chat system prompt includes:

- Current node graph summary (node types, IDs, names) — so the AI can reference nodes by name
- The currently selected node, if any
- For `fix-error` tool: the error messages are injected by the trigger, not inferred by the AI

The node context used in a tool call is captured at the time of the tool call, not at confirm time. If the user selects a different node after the AI calls a tool, the ActionCard still operates on the original target.

---

## Node Context in Chat

ChatView already passes `selectedNodeInfo` context to the AI. This becomes more explicit:

```typescript
// In the chat system prompt context
interface ChatContext {
  nodes: {id: string; type: string; name?: string}[] // all nodes
  selectedNodes?: {id: string; type: string; data: Record<string, unknown>}[]
}
```

This lets the AI say "I see you have an `osc~` node selected, I'll edit that" without the user needing to specify the node ID. When multiple objects are selected, ChatView sends all selected objects as context and the header summarizes the first two labels plus the remaining count.

---

## AiModeDescriptor Extensions (spec 94 additions)

Two new optional fields on `AiModeDescriptor`:

```typescript
export interface AiModeDescriptor {
  // ... existing fields from spec 94 ...

  /** Whether this mode is available as a chat tool */
  availableInChat?: boolean

  /** One-line description for the LLM tool definition */
  chatToolDescription?: string

  /** JSON Schema for the tool's input parameters */
  chatToolSchema?: object
}
```

Modes that don't make sense in chat context (e.g. `create-consumer` and `create-producer` which are triggered by a specific right-click) set `availableInChat: false`.

---

## File Changes

### New files

- `src/lib/ai/chat/canvas-tools.ts` — builds tool definitions from descriptors
- `src/lib/components/sidebar/ActionCard.svelte` — inline confirm UI for tool results

### Modified files

- `src/lib/ai/chat/resolver.ts` — handle tool call events alongside text chunks
- `src/lib/ai/modes/types.ts` — add `availableInChat` + `chatToolDescription` + `chatToolSchema` to `AiModeDescriptor`
- `src/lib/ai/modes/descriptors.ts` — fill in new fields for applicable modes
- `src/lib/components/sidebar/ChatView.svelte` — pass canvas callbacks, render ActionCards

---

## Implementation Plan

Prerequisite: spec 94 mode resolver architecture is in place.

1. **Extend `AiModeDescriptor`** — add `availableInChat`, `chatToolDescription`, `chatToolSchema`
2. **Fill descriptor fields** — for `single`, `multi`, `edit`, `replace`, `fix-error`, `decompose`
3. **Build `canvas-tools.ts`** — generate tool definitions from descriptors
4. **Update `chat/resolver.ts`** — handle tool call events, call mode resolver, emit `ActionCard` data
5. **Build `ActionCard.svelte`** — pending / applied / dismissed states, uses descriptor color + icon
6. **Wire `ChatView.svelte`** — pass canvas callbacks down, render ActionCards in message thread
7. **Update chat context** — include node graph summary in system prompt

Steps 1–3 can be done in parallel with steps 4–5.

## OpenRouter reasoning and stream failures

The provider retains reasoning text and structured reasoning details in the opaque model-turn state. Tool continuations replay structured blocks in their original order, including signatures and encrypted data, or plaintext reasoning when structured blocks are absent. Display text and encrypted-reasoning notices are separate from replay state.

SSE error events reject the generation even after HTTP 200 and partial output. No tools or generated edits from a failed turn are applied. JSON parsing catches only malformed JSON; consumer callback exceptions propagate. Both text generation and tool turns use the same stream reader.

## Completed turn duration

The in-flight reasoning header reads “Thinking”. Completed assistant messages with reasoning read “Worked for <x>s”, showing elapsed time from starting the submitted chat request to receiving its last non-empty response text chunk. This includes reasoning, tool rounds, and response generation, but excludes trailing stream metadata and persistence. Use a monotonic clock and store the duration with the assistant message. If a successful turn has no response text chunks, measure through stream completion. Messages without a recorded duration use “Worked”.
