# 100. P5 Surface Mode

## Goal

Allow `p5` sketches to run as transparent fullscreen performance overlays without copying their pixels into the normal video rendering chain.

## User API

P5 sketches can call `createSurfaceCanvas()` from `setup()`:

```javascript
function setup() {
  createSurfaceCanvas();
}

function draw() {
  clear();
  circle(mouseX, mouseY, 48);
}
```

`createSurfaceCanvas()` creates the p5 canvas at the current renderer output size. The user does not also call `createCanvas()`.

Surface-mode p5 also exposes:

- `expandSurface()` and `collapseSurface()` to enter or exit fullscreen surface mode from code.
- `hideExitButton()` to hide the overlay exit badge.
- `setMouseForwarding({ enabled, only, except })` to forward p5 mouse and wheel interaction to mouse-aware render nodes while expanded.

## Resizable Inline Canvases

Inline p5 sketches can call `setFluidSize()` to make their canvas follow a
user-resized Patchies node:

```javascript
function setup() {
  setFluidSize({ keepAspectRatio: true });
  createCanvas(400, 240);
}
```

`createCanvas()` is the single source of the initial size. When the node has
not been resized before, Patchies adopts the dimensions of the canvas p5
actually created. When a persisted node size exists, Patchies calls
`resizeCanvas()` after `createCanvas()` so the sketch starts at that size.
Subsequent node resizing also calls `resizeCanvas()`.
Patchies waits for p5 user setup to finish before deciding whether to clear a
previously saved node size, so top-level dynamic imports do not discard a
fluid sketch's resize state.

The fluid options are `showResizer`, `resize`, and `keepAspectRatio`.
`initialSize` is intentionally not supported for p5 because it would conflict
with `createCanvas()`. `createSurfaceCanvas()` and `setFluidSize()` are also
mutually exclusive: surface canvases follow the renderer output instead of a
node size.

## Preview And Expand Behavior

- Before expansion, the node shows a scaled preview of the surface-sized p5 canvas.
- When `createSurfaceCanvas()` has run, the node menu shows **Expand**.
- Expanding activates `SurfaceOverlay`, hides the editor, and re-runs the sketch with the p5 canvas mounted into the overlay layer.
- Collapsing restores the sketch to the inline preview.
- Expanded p5 canvases always fill the viewport height, remain horizontally centered, and preserve the canvas aspect ratio. Inline node resizing must not determine the expanded display size. The display follows viewport resizing without changing the sketch resolution.
- Surface-mode p5 output is transparent by default when user code uses `clear()` or draws alpha; `background()` remains available when the sketch intentionally covers the scene.

## Rendering Contract

Surface-mode p5 is a DOM overlay presentation, not a normal render-pipeline source. It should not require Hydra-style canvas source chaining or a p5-to-GL bitmap copy for the main fullscreen overlay path.

If a secondary `/output` window is connected, frames may still be mirrored from the p5 canvas to the output window until p5 can run directly in the output context.

## Notes

- `createSurfaceCanvas(WEBGL)` should remain possible by forwarding optional renderer arguments to p5.
- The existing `p5` object remains the only object type; no `surface.p5` object is introduced.
