The `js` object provides a full JavaScript environment with access to the [Patchies JavaScript Runner](/docs/javascript-runner) features such as `send`, `recv`, `setPortCount`, `onCleanup`, NPM imports, virtual filesystem and shared libraries.

## Special Methods

These methods are exclusive to the `js` object:

- **`setRunOnMount(true)`** - run the code automatically when the object is created. By default, code only runs when you hit the "Play" button.
- **`flash()`** - briefly flash the node's border, useful for visual feedback when processing messages.
- **`setPrimaryButton('run' | 'settings' | 'code')`** - choose the main action for the current layout.

## OpenCV

Use `await opencv()` to lazy-load OpenCV.js and wait for its WebAssembly runtime.
The module is cached across `js` objects, so separate nodes do not repeat initialization.

```js
const cv = await opencv();
const source = cv.matFromImageData(imageData);
const gray = new cv.Mat();

cv.cvtColor(source, gray, cv.COLOR_RGBA2GRAY);

source.delete();
gray.delete();
```

OpenCV allocations are manual: call `.delete()` on every `Mat`, vector, and other
OpenCV object when you finish using it.

## Examples

Here is how to log incoming messages while also flashing the console.

```js
setRunOnMount(true)
setPortCount(1, 0)

recv((data) => {
  console.log(data);
  flash();
});
```
