[ChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu) is a programming language for
real-time sound synthesis and music creation. Runs via [WebChucK](https://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/webchuck).

> Try this patch [in the app](/?demo=chuck-the-fourth)!
> From @dtinth's [ChucK experiments](https://dt.in.th/ChucKSong4).

## Getting Started

Try this ChucK code for outputting oscillator with a low-pass filter.

```chuck
SinOsc osc => LPF filter => dac;

220 => osc.freq;
50 => filter.freq;
1.0 => filter.Q;

while (true) {
  1::second => now;
}
```

## Actions

- **Replace Shred** (`Ctrl/Cmd + Enter`): replaces the most recent shred
- **Add Shred** (`Ctrl/Cmd + \`): adds a new shred
- **Remove Shred** (`Ctrl/Cmd + Backspace`): removes the most recent shred
- **Expand Editor**: opens the ChucK code in the detached overlay editor
- **Settings** in the overflow menu: see running shreds, remove any with "x"

## Editor Layout

The code editor is placed inlien into the patch.

- Select the object and drag the resize handles to change the container size. Code scrolls inside its container.
- Use **Disable Resizing** to lock that size.
- Use **Hide Code** for a compact object that keeps running headlessly. Clicking
  on the code button opens the code in the preferred editor (e.g. inline, sidebar)
- **Keep Editor in Patch** restores the inline editor.
- **Expand Editor** opens the editor in fullscreen.

To update code while it is hidden, connect a `js` object to the message inlet:

```javascript
// Store new code without interrupting the running program.
send({type: 'setCode', value: 'SinOsc osc => dac; 1::second => now;'})

// Run the stored code when you are ready.
send({type: 'bang'})
```

## Console Output

ChucK's `<<<` print statements are emitted as raw strings
from the message outlet.

## Presets

Enable the **ChucK Demos** preset pack to browse curated ChucK examples.
The pack includes playable starting points for FM tones, Shepard tones,
plucked strings, modal mallets, chorus pads, vocal synthesis, and noise
textures.

## Audio Input

ChucK accepts audio input for processing and analysis:

```chuck
adc => PitShift p => dac;
```

The blue audio inlet appears when your code references `adc`. Synth-only ChucK
code hides the inlet to keep the node compact.

## Global Variables

The [demo patch](/?demo=chuck-the-fourth) shows how global
variables let you control ChucK programs with Patchies messages.

Declare variables with `global` (e.g. `global int bpm`) and re-compute
dependent variables in a loop.

## FFT Analysis

![Patchies ChucK FFT demo](/content/images/chuck-fft.webp)

Use ChucK for audio analysis and applying filters - it receives audio inputs
and can emit events and global variables.
