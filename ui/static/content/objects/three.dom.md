The `three.dom` object creates 3D graphics using [Three.js](https://threejs.org). It runs on the main thread for low-latency DOM interaction.

> ✨ [Try this patch](/?demo=sleek-animated-torus) showing how to use 2D textures from other objects in Three.js!

## Getting Started

Define a `draw()` function to render each frame:

```javascript
const { Scene, PerspectiveCamera, BoxGeometry, Mesh, MeshNormalMaterial } = THREE;

const scene = new Scene();
const camera = new PerspectiveCamera(75, width / height, 0.1, 1000);
camera.position.z = 2;

const geometry = new BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1);
const material = new MeshNormalMaterial();
const cube = new Mesh(geometry, material);
scene.add(cube);

function draw() {
  cube.rotation.x += 0.01;
  cube.rotation.y += 0.01;
  renderer.render(scene, camera);
}
```

## Comparison with three

| Feature | `three` | `three.dom` |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Runs on | Web worker | Main thread |
| Video chaining | Fast, stays in the render pipeline | Slower, copies canvas back into the pipeline |
| Input latency | A little higher because pointer events are forwarded to the worker | Lowest, handles DOM input directly |
| Pointer drag/wheel | Yes, via `mouse`, `onPointerDrag()`, and `onWheel()` | Yes, via direct DOM mouse events |
| Orbit controls | Worker-safe `OrbitControls` compatibility layer | Three.js DOM `OrbitControls` |
| Keyboard events | No | Yes |
| DOM APIs | No | Yes |
| Video textures | Yes (`getTexture`) | No |

Use `three` for video chaining with pointer drag, wheel, and worker camera
controls. Use `three.dom` when interaction latency matters most, or when you need
keyboard events or DOM APIs.

## Available Variables

- `THREE` - the Three.js library
- `renderer` - WebGLRenderer instance
- `width`, `height` - output dimensions
- `mouse.x`, `mouse.y` - mouse position

## Special Functions (three.dom only)

- `setCanvasSize(width, height)` - resize output canvas
- `onKeyDown(callback)` - receive keydown events
- `onKeyUp(callback)` - receive keyup events

## Common Functions

See the [Patchies JavaScript Runner](/docs/javascript-runner) for all available functions.

- `setVideoOutput(true)` - enables the video output port, which is disabled by default
- `setHidePorts(true | false)` - hide/show all ports
- `noDrag()`, `noPan()`, `noWheel()`, `noInteract()` - see [Canvas Interaction](/docs/canvas-interaction)
- `noBorder()` - hides Patchies' border and selected glow until the call is removed and the node runs again
- `fft()` - audio analysis with low latency


## Custom Selection Styling

Use `onSelectionChange(callback)` with `noBorder()` to draw a selection indicator
that matches your widget's colors and rounded corners. The callback receives the
current selection immediately, then runs when selection changes.

See [Custom Selection Styling](/docs/js-integrations)
for an example and the shared API.
