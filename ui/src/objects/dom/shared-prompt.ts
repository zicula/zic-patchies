export const domSharedPrompt = `
- width, height: Container dimensions (undefined until setSize or setFluidSize)
- setSize(w, h): Set fixed container dimensions
- setFluidSize({ showResizer?, resize?, keepAspectRatio?, initialSize? }): Use a user-resizable container. resize is 'horizontal', 'vertical', or 'both'.
- onResize(({ width, height }) => {}): Run after a fluid container resize.
- setHidePorts(hide): Hide/show ports
- noDrag(), noPan(), noWheel(), noArrowKeyMove(), noInteract() - Interaction control (whole node)
- noArrowKeyMove() disables moving the node with arrow keys, including Shift + arrow keys. noInteract() includes this control.
- noBorder(): Hide Patchies border and selected glow
- onSelectionChange(callback): Calls callback(selected) immediately with current canvas selection, then only when it changes. Returns an unsubscribe function; subscriptions clear on rerun or destruction. Selection is separate from keyboard focus.
- onKeyDown(callback), onKeyUp(callback): Receive native KeyboardEvents while the preview or a control inside it is focused. Registered callbacks stop propagation to editor shortcuts, clear on rerun, and replace previous callbacks of the same kind.
- tailwind(enabled): Enable/disable Tailwind CSS (enabled by default)

**Responsive sizing and layout:**
- Default to fluid-sized components: call setFluidSize({ showResizer: false, initialSize: { width: 400, height: 300 } }) unless fixed sizing is explicitly requested or required by the component. Do not combine setFluidSize() with setSize().
- Pass showResizer: false by default; use showResizer: true only when visible resize handles are explicitly requested. Users can enable resizing from the node overflow menu.
- Fill the outer container using full width and height. Set outer padding and margins to zero unless explicitly requested.
- Scale text, controls, hit areas, and spacing with the current container dimensions, not just their positions. Use container-relative CSS units (with a size-query container) or update CSS variables/font size in onResize(). Initialize the layout once too.
- Use LARGE, readable fonts: at least 18px for labels and 24–32px for primary text at the initial size, growing with the UI scale. Avoid tiny fixed pixel sizes or fixed Tailwind text classes that stop text from scaling.
- Make form controls inherit the responsive font size. Use em-based control padding and spacing so the whole UI scales together; internal control padding is allowed, but outer container padding defaults to zero.

**Selective canvas interaction (CSS classes):**
Apply these classes to individual elements to block canvas interactions only for that element:
- "nodrag" — prevent node drag when the user interacts with this element
- "nopan" — prevent canvas pan when the user interacts with this element
- "nowheel" — prevent canvas zoom when scrolling over this element

**Experimental HTML-in-Canvas**
Only use these when user explicitly asks for "HTML in Canvas"
- htmlCanvas.videoOutput(options): exposes the DOM node as a video source; call htmlCanvas.videoOutput() to match the render output size, htmlCanvas.videoOutput(false) to disable, or htmlCanvas.videoOutput({ size: "free" }) to let the DOM content choose its own source size before Patchies fits it into the render output; mutually exclusive with canvasLayer and glslLayer
- htmlCanvas.canvasLayer(callback): locally post-processes the live DOM interface with a 2D canvas without adding video output; callback receives (ctx, { width, height, displayWidth, displayHeight, pixelRatio, time, delta }); call htmlCanvas.canvasLayer(false) to disable; mutually exclusive with videoOutput and glslLayer
- htmlCanvas.glslLayer(fragmentShader): locally post-processes the live DOM interface with a WebGL2 GLSL ES 3 fragment shader and source sampler; use texture(source, uv), mainImage(out vec4 fragColor, in vec2 fragCoord), source, iResolution, iTime, iTimeDelta, and iFrame; supports #include directives; mutually exclusive with videoOutput and canvasLayer
